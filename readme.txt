This readme is to explain what is the readme.md file

----------------------------------------------------------------

readme.md is just a regular text file with Markdown syntax,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown

Markdown is used in code repositories to add additional formatting,
such as headings, bold words, or hyper-links

For example the following creates a Heading Levels 1, 2, and 3:

# Header Level 1
## Header Level 2
### Header Level 3

and the next line makes the word "bold" in bold ("strong") lettering

This sentence contains a **bold** word in it.

----------------------------------------------------------------

To view the md files you can use any text editor to see the raw text.

If you search for Markdown viewers you can find a number of tools that
will render the final formatting of the .md file

The following are some markdown viewers that are provided for convenience.
They are not endorsed by the USGS, nor does the order indicate any order of preference.
