This readme is to explain what is the readme.md file

----------------------------------------------------------------

readme.md is a regular text file with Markdown syntax,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown

Markdown is used in code repositories to add additional formatting,
such as headings, bold words, or hyper-links

For example the following creates a Heading Levels 1, 2, and 3:

# Header Level 1
## Header Level 2
### Header Level 3

and the next line makes the word "bold" in bold ("strong") lettering

This sentence contains a **bold** word in it.

----------------------------------------------------------------

To view the md files you can use any text editor to see the raw text.

If you search for Markdown viewers you can find a number of tools that
will render the final formatting of the .md file

The following are some markdown viewers that are provided for convenience.
