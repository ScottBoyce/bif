# Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a U.S. Government open source project! 

If you're unsure about anything, just ask. Or if you belong to code.usgs.gov submit a merge request. 

The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. 

We love all friendly contributions. However it is required to join code.usgs.gov which runs using the [GitLab Architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html).



# Joining code.usgs.gov

All USGS employees and contractors automatically have accounts with code.usgs.gov and may log in using their DOI smartcard. 
Department of Interior (DOI) employees should be able to create accounts as well.

External collaborators (non-USGS) are free to join, but require a USGS employee to request creation of their account. 

Please contact one of the following with your name, affiliation, email, desired username, and sentence as to why you want to be added to the code.usgs.gov

| Contact       | Email              |

# Issue Guidelines

In the interest of making it easier for our contributors to manage site issues, we request that issues follow certain guidelines.  Our developers mainly use [Gitlab Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/) to identify and prioritize their work.  If you have questions about BiF, https://code.usgs.gov/fortran/bif, or would like start a general discussion, we kindly request that you email us at one of the Join code.usgs.gov emails above.  Our issue guidelines are a living document and a work in progress, so feel free to offer feedback on it, by emailing us.

 - **Specific**: The issue makes specific requests.  An example of a specific request would be `Add Local Water Storage to FMP`.   An example of a non-specific request would be `Improve FMP Compuational Speed`.
 - **Measurable**: The issue has specific requirements and can be closed when those requirements are met.  This helps us track the progress in addressing problems.  For example, general refactoring is always something to work on, so we should create separate issues for this, such as `Convert DO to DO CONCURRENT for SUBROUTINE XYZ` and `Convert ASSOCAITE Blocks to independent SUBROUTINE in File.f90`, rather than `Add DO CONCURRENT`.
 - **Actionable**BiF team or community.  An example of something actionable would be `Fix SFR warning XYZ to appear in both LIST and WARN files`.  An example of something that isn't actionable by our team or community is `My research group wants to fork BiF`.
 - **Realistic**: The issue is something that is achievable by the resources of the project, including contributions from the open source community. 
 - **Time-Aware**: The issue is something that can be resolved within 6 months.  If you think your issue might take longer, we encourage you to break up your issues into smaller issues (like stepping stones) that we can address.  We can still work on big problems, but it is easier for us to track progress and identify what we need to work on, when big problems are broken up into smaller ones.

============

Contributions are welcome from the community. Questions can be asked on the [issues page][1].
